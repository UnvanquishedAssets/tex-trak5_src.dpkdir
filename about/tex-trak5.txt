	Notes
		- *_p.* files are preview images generated from the diffuse maps.

	Changes:
		- The normal maps have been converted by using the inverted alpha
		  channel as the blue channel and removing the alpha channel. The
		  imagemagick command was:
		  convert <old> -channel b -fx "1.0 - u.a*1.0" -alpha off <new>
		- Addition maps may have been desaturated and put into grayscale mode.#
		- Completely white alpha channels were removed.
		- The file formats have been converted.
